# InstagramPhish
Open-Source Instagram Phishing Tool

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.
Do not click on any links listed in the email message, and do not open any attachments contained in a suspicious email. Do not enter personal information in a pop-up screen. Legitimate companies, agencies, and organisations don't ask for personal information via pop-up screens.
